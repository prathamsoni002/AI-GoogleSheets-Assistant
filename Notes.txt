📌 Explanation of Each Folder & File
1️⃣ Root Files (General Project Setup)
File	Purpose
.gitignore	Prevents committing API keys, virtual environments, etc.
README.md	Explains project purpose, setup, and usage.
requirements.txt	Lists all dependencies for easy installation.
main.py	The main entry point, orchestrates all modules.
2️⃣ config/ (Stores Configurations & API Keys)
File	Purpose
config.py	Stores API keys, authentication, and project-wide settings.
📌 Dependencies: Used by google_sheets.py & openai_api.py to fetch API keys.

3️⃣ core/ (Core Business Logic: AI + Google Sheets)
File	Purpose
google_sheets.py	Handles Google Sheets API calls (reading/writing data).
openai_api.py	Manages AI interactions with OpenAI API.
processor.py	Processes user inputs, detects errors, & calls AI logic.
📌 Why separate processor.py?

It acts as a middle layer between Google Sheets & AI, keeping things modular.
Instead of openai_api.py making decisions, it only fetches AI responses.
processor.py will interpret results, handle logic, and decide actions.
4️⃣ ui/ (Manages User Interface)
File	Purpose
chatbot.py	Manages chatbot interaction (command-line based).
chatbot_ui.py	GUI-based chatbot (Tkinter/PyQt) if we go visual.
📌 Why separate UI logic?

Decouples UI from core logic, so we can switch between CLI or GUI anytime.
chatbot.py can be text-based, while chatbot_ui.py is a visual chat interface.
5️⃣ utils/ (Helper Functions & Logging)
File	Purpose
helpers.py	Reusable functions (e.g., validating data, formatting responses).
logger.py	Logs errors, user actions, and system activity for debugging.
📌 Why a separate logger.py?

Helps with debugging, tracking AI responses, and monitoring user interactions.
6️⃣ tests/ (Unit Testing for Each Module)
File	Purpose
test_sheets.py	Tests Google Sheets interactions.
test_openai.py	Tests OpenAI responses & error handling.
test_processor.py	Tests AI-powered automation logic.
📌 Why testing?

Ensures each module works independently.
Helps catch errors early before deployment.
📌 Benefits of This Structure
✅ Modular → Each module has a clear purpose, making debugging easy.
✅ Scalable → If we expand features (e.g., different AI models), we just modify core/.
✅ Decoupled UI → We can switch between CLI, GUI, or even a web-based chatbot later.
✅ Easier Collaboration → Multiple people can work on different modules without conflict.
