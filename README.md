 ngrok http 5000 #Paste that on the ngrok terminal.

In order to work with the google sheets, first we have to share the access to the file as an editor to the client email (here it means API email. You will get this from the credentails.json file from config).

Run this to do basic checking. 

in the chatot.py you can see the templates for 'translate', 'update' etc.



Make a csv file data for the worksheet. 
Write a query like:
'Workseet file name' ready for analysis


and find a report for a product using:
report: 103301GBSTANDARD in P1

Now it will generate the images on the chatbot. If that images are visible, then you have to go to one of the source URL (CLTR + SHIFT + C) -> inspect element - > copy URL -> Go to that URL -> There will be option to select 'Accept and Allow'. This is because we are using the NGROK URL so it to be visible, hence it might required an acceptance for once. 



To run the Validation of the file:
Make sure Selenium server is active -> Upload the file -> No text requried. 

To do the In file translation: Workes only with TEST AI workbook. Copy paste the filed on the excel on the same location and then go to the chatbot and type 'translate'
